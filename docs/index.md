# â€‹CronSpell

Date-expression domain specific language parsing. A neat way to express things like "First Saturday of any year", or "3rd thursdays each month" and such

## Features

### Python

Cronspell is heavily inspired by Grafana's relative Date picker user interface. It shines when configuration is needed to reflect irregular date-distances such as in the example below.

`cronspell` lets you express relative dates such as "last saturday of last month" and converts it to a date object for use in your python project.

Installation: `pip install cronspell`

### Cli

The same interface, exposed to the command line. Formatted via `isodate` by default -- which is
open for coniguration using the `--format` option.

Installation with cli-specific dependencies: `pip install cronspell[cli]`


## Example

To get the last saturday of last month:

```
"now /m -1d /sat"
```

The same, more verbose:
```
"now /month -1day /sat"
```

which instructs the parser to perform the following sequence of operations:
